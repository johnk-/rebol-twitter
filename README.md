rebol-twitter
=============

Library to use twitter from Rebol R3

This is a direct port of Christopher Ross-Gill's twitter library to Rebol R3

Instructions on use and configuration are here:

This is alpha level debug only code!

Note that you must still use Rebol 2 to create a twitter users file as this requires https support. This means that you need to use either the Atronix or Saphir builds as the current rebolsource build does not  contain https.
I have tested this succesfully with the Atronix build (on stackoverflow chat).
