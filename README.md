rebol-twitter
=============

Library to use twitter from Rebol R3

This is a direct port of Christopher Ross-Gill's twitter library to Rebol R3

Instructions on use and configuration are here:

http://www.ross-gill.com/page/Twitter_API_and_REBOL

This is alpha level debug only code!

Note that you must still use Rebol 2 to create a twitter users file as this requires https support and the current linux build of Rebol 3 does not include https which meas that following the recent api change at twitter this is currently not working.

Hopefully once we have https up and running we can get this updated.
